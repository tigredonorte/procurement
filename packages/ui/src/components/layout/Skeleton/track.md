# Skeleton Component Development Track

## 1) Analysis and Planning

- **Current (BRT):** 2025-09-13 00:50
- Analyzed test failures: VariantTests, AccessibilityTest, VisualStates
- Identified issues with animation detection and ARIA attributes
- Component supports text, circular, rectangular, and wave variants
- Custom implementation with count, spacing, and styling features

## 2) Test Implementation

- **Current (BRT):** 2025-09-13 00:51
- Found comprehensive test coverage for basic functionality
- Need to fix 3 failing tests:
  - VariantTests: Wave animation detection
  - AccessibilityTest: ARIA attributes validation
  - VisualStates: Static animation assertion
- Missing optional tests: KeyboardNavigation, ScreenReader, FocusManagement, Performance, Integration

## 3) Component Implementation

- **Current (BRT):** 2025-09-13 00:51
- Component built on MUI Skeleton with custom enhancements
- Supports glassmorphism and shimmer effects
- Multiple skeleton rendering with Stack layout
- Wave variant maps to rectangular with wave animation

## 4) Validation and Testing

- **Current (BRT):** 2025-09-13 00:51
- Current status: 16/18 validation checks passing
- 3 test stories failing, 25 passing (28 total)
- Need to fix animation property detection in tests
- Add proper ARIA attributes handling

## 5) Storybook Tests
