### Current Task: Fix Storybook Integration Issues - IN PROGRESS

Taking over from omega-505 to resolve the remaining 2/18 validation check failures.

**Previous Status by omega-505:**

- Component implementation is correct and functional ✅
- 16/18 validation checks PASS ✅
- Storybook integration tests BLOCKED by module loading issues ⚠️

**omega-511 Action Plan:**

- [x] Take over component ownership
- [x] Identify root cause of Storybook module loading failures
- [ ] Fix dynamic import issues in test stories
- [ ] Resolve "Failed to fetch dynamically imported module" errors
- [ ] Achieve all 18/18 validation checks PASS
- [ ] Update status to completed

### Validation Status (Target: 18/18 checks PASS):

✅ 1. Docs catalog check - PASS
✅ 2. components.tasks.md entry check - PASS  
✅ 3. Change-scope guard - PASS
✅ 4. Test-bypass pattern scan - PASS
✅ 5. Storybook reachability - PASS
✅ 6. TypeScript check (scoped) - PASS
✅ 7. ESLint fix (scoped) - PASS
✅ 8. tsup build (scoped) - PASS
✅ 9. ESLint verify (scoped) - PASS
✅ 10. Folder structure - PASS
✅ 11. Barrel export - PASS
✅ 12. Stories coverage - PASS
✅ 13. Design tokens usage - PASS
✅ 14. Responsive story present - PASS
✅ 15. Accessibility coverage - PASS
✅ 16. track.md validation - PASS
❌ 17. Storybook integration tests - FAILING (module loading)
❌ 18. Test story execution - FAILING (dynamic import errors)

### Current Issue Analysis:

The Storybook test runner is encountering "Failed to fetch dynamically imported module" errors for both main stories and test stories. This suggests either:

1. Import path issues in the story files
2. Missing exports in the component files
3. Circular dependency issues
4. Storybook configuration problems

Investigating and fixing these issues is the focus for omega-511.
