## Changes Made

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Removed duplicate type definitions**: PhoneInputProps was defined in both PhoneInput.tsx and PhoneInput.types.ts. Now only defined in types file.
2. **Fixed weak test assertions**: Removed all conditional checks (if statements) in tests and replaced with deterministic assertions.
3. **Added comprehensive phone number tests**: Added tests for country code selection and phone number formatting.
4. **Fixed accessibility**: Added proper ARIA attributes to country selector button.
5. **Fixed TypeScript errors**: Properly typed event handlers and removed use of 'any'.
6. **Fixed ESLint errors**: Replaced performance.now() with Date.now() to avoid undefined reference.

### Test Enhancements:
- Tests now verify actual phone number formatting behavior
- Tests verify country code selection and dial code changes
- Tests verify validation states properly
- Tests use deterministic assertions without conditionals
- Added two new test stories: CountryCodeSelection and PhoneNumberFormatting
