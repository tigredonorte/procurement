## Implementation Notes

### Mock Data System
- Implemented realistic mock addresses for testing when API key is 'demo-key' or 'test-key'
- Mock data includes 5 US addresses with full structured data
- Mock place details include all address components and coordinates
- Simulates API delays for realistic testing

### Test Improvements
- All tests now verify actual component behavior, not just presence
- Autocomplete suggestion tests wait for and verify dropdown options
- Address selection tests verify structured data extraction
- Keyboard navigation tests verify Arrow/Enter key functionality
- Edge case tests verify minimum character requirement and no results handling
- Integration tests verify geolocation feature with mock location

### TypeScript Improvements
- Created proper interfaces for MockPrediction and MockPlaceDetails
- Fixed all type errors with proper Google Maps API types
- No use of 'any' type - all data properly typed
