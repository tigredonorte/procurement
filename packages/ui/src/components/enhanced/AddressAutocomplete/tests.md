## Implementation Notes

### Mock Data System (Enhanced by omega-811)

- Implemented realistic mock addresses for testing when API key is 'demo-key' or 'test-key'
- Mock data expanded to 7 US addresses with full structured data
- Enhanced mock predictions with proper matched_substrings and terms arrays
- Mock place details include all address components and coordinates
- Realistic API delays (150-350ms) with variance for authentic experience
- Improved search algorithm with multi-word matching and relevance sorting

### Test Improvements (Enhanced by omega-811)

- Replaced shallow text matching with robust behavioral assertions
- Enhanced autocomplete tests to verify actual option selection and callbacks
- Address selection tests verify complete structured data extraction with coordinates
- Keyboard navigation tests enhanced with proper Arrow/Enter key handling
- Edge case tests improved to handle no-results and character limit scenarios
- Integration tests verify full geolocation workflow with realistic mock data
- Added timeout handling and more robust element detection
- Fixed element selection to use role-based queries instead of text matching

### TypeScript Improvements

- Created proper interfaces for MockPrediction and MockPlaceDetails
- Fixed all type errors with proper Google Maps API types
- No use of 'any' type - all data properly typed

## Enhancement Summary (omega-811)

### Key Improvements Made:

1. **Enhanced Google Maps API Simulation**: Added more sophisticated search logic with multi-word matching and relevance scoring
2. **Expanded Mock Data**: Increased from 5 to 7 mock addresses with realistic matched_substrings and terms
3. **Improved Test Assertions**: Replaced shallow text-finding with robust behavioral verification
4. **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced timeout handling and element detection reliability
5. **Realistic API Delays**: Added variable delays (150-350ms) to simulate real Google Maps API behavior

### Current Status (Verified - omega-9001):

- ✅ 18/18 validation checks PASS (verified with --skip-cache)
- ✅ TypeScript clean, ESLint clean
- ✅ Component builds successfully
- ✅ ALL 11/11 test stories PASS (100% success rate)
- ✅ All timing and context issues resolved
- ✅ Real behavioral assertions implemented
- ✅ Realistic Google Maps API simulation completed

### Production Readiness:
