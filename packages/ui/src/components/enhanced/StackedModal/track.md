### Current Task: Component validation and test story export fixes (omega-26)

- Fixed ESLint errors by extracting hook usage into proper React components
- Added all required story exports: AllVariants, AllSizes, AllStates, InteractiveStates, Responsive
- Component builds successfully without TypeScript or ESLint errors
- All stories coverage validation checks now pass

### Next Steps:

- Final validation run to ensure all 14 checks pass
- Update components.tasks.md status to completed
