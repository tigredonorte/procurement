# PasswordStrength Component - Track.md

## Component Overview

A comprehensive password strength indicator with visual feedback, requirement checking, and multiple display variants. Features real-time strength calculation, animated progress indicators, and customizable requirements validation with helpful suggestions.

## Component Parameters

- value: string - Current password value to analyze
- showRequirements: boolean - Display requirements checklist
- requirements: PasswordRequirements - Custom password requirements object
- showStrengthLabel: boolean - Display strength label (Very Weak to Strong)
- showSuggestions: boolean - Show improvement suggestions
- variant: 'linear' | 'circular' | 'steps' - Visual indicator style
- animated: boolean - Enable animations and transitions

## Lint Status

- [x] No lint errors
- [x] No warnings

### Lint Errors to Fix:

None - all ESLint issues resolved.

## Type Check Status

- [x] No type errors
- [x] All props properly typed

### Type Errors to Fix:

None - component builds successfully with TypeScript.

## Missing things

### Test Coverage Issues

1. **Strength Calculation Tests**: Tests verify that strength values change (e.g., `expect(strengthValue).toBeLessThan(40)` for weak passwords), but don't verify the actual calculation algorithm correctness. They should test specific expected strength values for known passwords.

2. **Requirements Validation**: Tests check for presence of CheckIcon/CloseIcon but don't verify each specific requirement (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars) is correctly evaluated.

3. **Variant-Specific Behavior**:
   - Circular variant: No tests for the actual circular progress rendering or percentage display
   - Steps variant: No tests verifying correct number of active/completed steps based on strength
   - Tests only check that variants can be switched, not their visual behavior

4. **Custom Requirements**: No tests for custom requirement configurations (e.g., different minLength, disabled requirements)

5. **Suggestions Feature**: `showSuggestions` prop exists but tests don't verify suggestion content or display logic

6. **Animation Testing**: `animated` prop is unused in implementation (line 223 has eslint-disable comment) and not tested

7. **Edge Cases Incomplete**:
   - Unicode password test doesn't verify how non-ASCII characters affect strength calculation
   - No tests for passwords with spaces, quotes, or other special edge cases
   - No tests for extremely long passwords (>100 chars)

8. **Color/Theme Testing**: Tests don't verify that colors change appropriately with strength levels (error→warning→info→success)

9. **Accessibility**: Screen reader test only checks element existence, doesn't verify ARIA labels or announcements

10. **Performance**: Performance test only types rapidly but doesn't measure or assert on performance metrics

### Implementation Issues

1. **Unused Prop**: `animated` prop is accepted but never used in the component (ESLint disabled on line 223)

2. **Missing ARIA Labels**: Progress bars and strength indicators lack proper ARIA labels for accessibility
