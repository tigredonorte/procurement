## Test Enhancement Summary

**LATEST VERIFICATION [omega-6005] - 2025-09-12 21:00:**

- ✅ All 18/18 validation checks PASS
- ✅ All 11 test stories verified passing via test-storybook
- ✅ TypeScript compilation clean
- ✅ ESLint validation clean
- ✅ Component production-ready

**COMPLETED ENHANCEMENTS [omega-813]:**

1. **Replaced weak assertions with strong behavioral verification:**
   - Added `waitForAnimationLoad` helper to verify actual Lottie animation loading

2. **Added tests for critical animation functionality:**
   - Animation loading and SVG rendering verification
   - Interactive play/pause controls with keyboard navigation
   - Animation speed and direction configuration testing
   - Completion callbacks and segment playback functionality
   - Responsive size configuration with pixel-perfect validation
   - Visual effects (glass background, glow, hover states)
   - Loading state and error handling verification
   - Progress indicator behavior for non-looping animations
   - ARIA attributes and accessibility compliance

3. **Test story improvements:**
   - All expected test story names implemented
   - Strong assertions replace previous weak placeholder tests
   - Real animation behavior verification instead of simple presence checks
   - Comprehensive coverage of component features and edge cases
   - TypeScript and ESLint clean implementation

4. **Validation status:**
   - All 17/17 component validation checks structure completed
