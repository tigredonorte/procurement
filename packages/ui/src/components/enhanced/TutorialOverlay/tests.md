## Implementation Fixes Applied (omega-715)

### Fixed Missing Features
- Added `id` property to TutorialStep interface
- Added `position` property (tests use position not placement)
- Added `requiresAction` property to steps
- Added `variant` prop (tooltip, modal, highlight, spotlight)
- Added `allowSkip` prop
- Added `animated` prop
- Added progress text display ("1 of 2")
- Added Skip button when `allowSkip` is true
- Added proper ARIA attributes (aria-labelledby, aria-describedby)
- Added "Finish" button text for last step (vs "Complete")
- Added `onStepComplete` callback prop
- Fixed variant handling for modal and spotlight modes

### Key Behavioral Implementations
1. **Step Navigation**: Next/Previous buttons with proper state management
2. **Progress Indicator**: Both visual bar and text ("1 of 2") display
3. **Skip Functionality**: Optional skip button and Escape key handling
4. **Positioning**: Smart tooltip positioning with viewport bounds checking
5. **Spotlight Effect**: Highlight target element with darkened backdrop
6. **Variants**: Support for tooltip, modal, highlight, and spotlight modes
7. **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys and Escape key support
8. **Focus Management**: Proper focus trapping in dialog mode
9. **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes for screen readers
10. **Edge Cases**: Handles empty steps array, single steps, missing targets
