# TutorialOverlay Component - Track.md

## Component Overview

An interactive tutorial overlay system for guiding users through application features. Provides step-by-step walkthroughs with highlighted elements, tooltips, navigation controls, and customizable styling. Supports complex tutorial flows with branching and conditional steps.

## Component Parameters

- active: boolean - Whether tutorial overlay is active
- steps: TutorialStep[] - Array of tutorial step definitions
- currentStep: number - Currently active step index
- onStepChange: function - Callback when step changes
- onComplete: function - Callback when tutorial completes
- onSkip: function - Callback when tutorial is skipped
- showSkip: boolean - Show skip tutorial option
- highlightPadding: number - Padding around highlighted elements
- backdrop: boolean - Show backdrop overlay
- position: string - Tooltip positioning strategy
- theme: object - Custom styling theme
- navigation: boolean - Show next/previous navigation

## Missing things

### Issues Found in Implementation vs Tests:

1. **Single Step Button Label Issue**: Test expects "Complete" button for single-step tutorials, but implementation shows "Finish" (line 512 in implementation vs test expectation in EdgeCases story)

2. **Finish Button Implementation**: The test in IntegrationTest story queries for a "Finish" button (line 578), but the implementation condition on line 512 shows `steps.length === 1 ? 'Complete' : 'Finish'` - which is backwards from what tests expect

3. **requiresAction Property**: The `requiresAction` property is defined in types (line 31) and used in tests (line 131) but not actually implemented in the component logic - it doesn't affect behavior

4. **Keyboard Navigation TypeScript Issue**: The implementation uses browser's KeyboardEvent (line 353) but imports a custom KeyboardEvent type which may cause conflicts

5. **Previous Button Conditional Logic**: The Previous button has redundant condition check - appears both in wrapping condition (line 482) and as disabled prop (line 487)
