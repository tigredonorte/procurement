## Notes

Timeline component has been enhanced with comprehensive behavioral test assertions. Fixed fake PASS elements and implemented real test verification:

### Key Test Improvements:
- **Basic Interaction**: Real assertions for timeline item rendering, clicks, and expand/collapse functionality
- **Form Interaction**: Proper testing of action buttons and detailed variant behavior  
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete keyboard accessibility testing with Tab/Enter/Space keys
- **Screen Reader**: Semantic HTML verification and accessible content structure
- **Focus Management**: Focus retention and proper focus flow through interactive elements
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile layout, touch targets, and text wrapping verification
- **Theme Variations**: Glass morphism effects, custom colors, and gradient styling tests
- **Visual States**: Hover effects, animations, and alternating layout verification  
- **Performance**: Large dataset rendering (50 items) and interaction speed testing
- **Edge Cases**: Long text handling, empty data, and metadata overflow scenarios
- **Integration**: Complete horizontal orientation and all props working together

All 11 test stories now have comprehensive behavioral assertions that verify actual component functionality rather than fake PASS status elements. Component passes all 16 validation checks.
