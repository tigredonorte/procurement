## Missing things

**Test Quality Assessment:**

- ✅ Tests have REAL behavioral assertions, not fake passes
- ✅ Each test scenario properly verifies actual component behavior:
  - BasicInteraction: Tests item clicks, expand/collapse with visibility checks
  - FormInteraction: Verifies action buttons work and don't trigger item clicks
  - KeyboardNavigation: Tests Tab, Enter, Space keys with focus state verification
  - ScreenReader: Checks semantic HTML structure and accessible content
  - FocusManagement: Verifies focus retention and proper focus flow
  - ResponsiveDesign: Tests mobile layout, touch targets, and text wrapping
  - ThemeVariations: Verifies glass morphism effects and custom styling
  - VisualStates: Tests hover states, animations, and alternating layout
  - Performance: Tests rendering 50 items and interaction speed
  - EdgeCases: Verifies long text, empty data, and metadata overflow handling
  - Integration: Tests horizontal orientation with all features combined

**Implementation Quality:**

- ✅ Component fully implemented with all variants (default, compact, detailed)
- ✅ Supports vertical/horizontal orientations
- ✅ Animated item entrance with staggered delays
- ✅ Expandable items with smooth transitions
- ✅ Glass morphism card styling with backdrop blur
- ✅ Custom icon and color support for timeline dots
- ✅ Metadata display with styled chips
- ✅ Action buttons with proper event handling
- ✅ Alternating layout for visual interest
- ✅ Proper TypeScript typing with interfaces

**No critical issues found** - Component is production-ready with comprehensive test coverage.
