## Test Enhancement Summary (omega-714)

**Issue Fixed**: Tests were superficial, only checking element existence without verifying actual timing values, calculations, or interactive features.

**Comprehensive Improvements Made**:
- **Timing Calculations**: Tests now verify actual percentage widths, offset positions, and timing value accuracy
- **Duration Representations**: Validates proper formatting (ms vs seconds) and display of timing values
- **Timeline Markers**: Tests timeline axis labels and total time calculations
- **Interactive Features**: Comprehensive hover, tooltip, and focus state testing
- **Proper Scaling**: Verifies proportional scaling and cumulative offset positioning
- **Variant-Specific Tests**: Each variant (waterfall, stacked, horizontal) has targeted behavioral assertions
- **Edge Case Handling**: Tests zero values, partial data, and graceful degradation
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes, screen reader compatibility, and keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Large value handling and rendering performance validation

**Real Behavioral Assertions**: All tests now include meaningful assertions that verify actual component functionality rather than just element existence.
