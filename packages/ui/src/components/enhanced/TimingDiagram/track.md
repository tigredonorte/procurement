# TimingDiagram Component - Track.md

## Component Overview

A network timing diagram component for visualizing HTTP request phases and performance metrics. Displays DNS lookup, connection, SSL/TLS, request, and response phases in waterfall, stacked, or horizontal layouts with animations and tooltips.

## Component Parameters

- data: TimingData - Object containing timing measurements for each phase (dns, connect, ssl, request, response, total)
- variant: 'waterfall' | 'stacked' | 'horizontal' - Display layout variant
- showLabels: boolean - Show timing labels on segments
- showTooltips: boolean - Enable hover tooltips
- animated: boolean - Enable animations for segments
- height: number - Diagram height in pixels
- color: string - Custom color override (unused in current implementation)

## Lint Status

- [x] No lint errors
- [x] No warnings

### Lint Errors to Fix:

None - all lint errors have been resolved.

## Type Check Status

- [x] No type errors
- [x] All props properly typed

### Type Errors to Fix:

None - component has proper TypeScript types with separate types file.

## Testing Scenarios Coverage

- [x] Network request timing phases render correctly
- [x] Waterfall, stacked, and horizontal variants display properly
- [x] Timing labels and tooltips work as expected
- [x] Animations and transitions function smoothly
- [x] Different timing data scales (fast/normal/slow requests)
- [x] Interactive state changes with buttons
- [x] Responsive behavior across viewports
- [x] Performance with various timing data
- [x] Accessibility with proper contrast and tooltips
- [x] Edge cases (minimal data, missing phases)
- [x] Multiple request comparisons
- [x] Color coding for different phases
