## Issues Found

### Story Issues
1. Stories reference props that don't exist in component:
   - `theme` prop (not in CodeProps)
   - `showLineNumbers` prop (should be `lineNumbers`)
   - `terminal` variant (should be 'highlight')
   - `wrap` prop (not in CodeProps)
2. Missing test stories file

### Component Issues
1. Missing index.tsx file (has index.ts but should be index.tsx per naming convention)
