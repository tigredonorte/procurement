## Missing things

**Tests**: None - All tests are comprehensive with proper assertions. The component has 11 test stories covering:

- Basic interaction testing (real DOM element checks)
- Keyboard navigation (proper focus behavior verification)
- Screen reader support (aria attributes)
- Focus management (tabIndex behavior)
- Responsive design (viewport testing with computed styles)
- Theme variations (color property verification)
- Visual states (variant testing with style comparison)
- Performance (render time measurement)
- Edge cases (empty content, long text, special characters)
- Integration testing (multiple paragraph composition)

**Implementation**: None - The component properly implements paragraph typography functionality:

- Complete Typography component integration with MUI
- Proper variant system (default, lead, muted, small) with distinct styling
- Color theming support with theme palette integration
- Size system (xs, sm, md, lg, xl) with appropriate font sizes and line heights
- Proper styled-component architecture with theme integration
- Semantic paragraph rendering with correct HTML structure
- Forward ref implementation for proper DOM access
- Accessibility support through MUI Typography base
