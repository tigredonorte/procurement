## omega-521 Summary

Successfully took over Heading component from omega-8 and upgraded it from 16/16 to 18/18 validation checks. Resolved critical React element type errors by implementing a more robust architecture using direct HTML elements instead of problematic MUI Typography component prop. All tests now pass consistently.
