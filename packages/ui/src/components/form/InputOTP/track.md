# InputOTP Component - Track.md

## Component Overview

InputOTP is a specialized input component for one-time passwords and verification codes. It provides individual digit inputs with automatic focus management, paste support, keyboard navigation, and various visual effects. The component supports numeric, alphanumeric, and masked input modes with comprehensive validation.

## Component Parameters

- `variant` - Input type ('numeric' | 'alphanumeric' | 'masked')
- `color` - Theme color ('primary' | 'secondary' | 'success' | 'warning' | 'danger' | 'neutral')
- `size` - Input size ('xs' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl')
- `length` - Number of OTP digits
- `value` - Current OTP value
- `onChange` - Value change callback
- `onComplete` - Completion callback when all digits filled
- `glass` - Enables glass morphism effect
- `gradient` - Enables gradient focus effect
- `autoFocus` - Auto-focuses first input
- `error` - Error state styling
- `disabled` - Disables all inputs
