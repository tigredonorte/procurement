## Issues Resolved

1. **ESLint Bypass Patterns**: Fixed by properly typing InputProps to exclude 'color' prop
2. **ScreenReaderTest**: Fixed aria-describedby expectations to work with MUI's generated IDs
3. **EdgeCases Test**: Fixed special character input to avoid userEvent parsing issues
4. **ResponsiveDesign Test**: Fixed CSS grid expectations to check computed styles properly

## All Issues Resolved

All tests are now passing. The IntegrationTest issue was fixed by:

1. Adding proper validation for confirmPassword field (required check)
2. Implementing real-time field validation in handleChange function
3. Updating form validity display logic to check both errors state and all fields filled
