### Broken Tests

1. **Basic Interaction**: Cannot find dropdown options - MUI Select options don't render with expected data-testid attributes
2. **Form Interaction**: Testing library finds multiple elements with "Form Select" text (label and fieldset legend)
3. **State Change**: Using .toHaveDisplayValue() on MUI Select div - need to use different assertion method
4. **Keyboard Navigation**: Focus management test fails - MUI Select focus behavior differs from standard inputs
5. **Performance**: Option elements not rendered with expected data-testid pattern for performance testing
