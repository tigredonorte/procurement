### Broken Stories:

1. (List any broken stories)

### Broken Tests Summary:

**CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:**

1. All tests are looking for `data-testid` containers but not finding the slider elements properly
2. The Slider component is not exposing the correct test-ids to child elements
3. Tests are failing because they expect wrapper divs with test-ids, but the component structure is different

**DETAILED FAILURES:**

1. **Keyboard Navigation Test** - FAIL
   - Issue: Arrow key press not changing slider value
   - Error: `expected 50 to be greater than 50`
   - Root cause: Keyboard events not properly simulated or slider not responding

2. **Screen Reader Test** - FAIL
   - Issue: Slider element doesn't have role="slider" attribute
   - Error: `element.getAttribute("role") returns null`
   - Root cause: MUI Slider might be using different ARIA structure

3. **Other Tests** - Need investigation
   - All likely failing due to similar element selection issues
   - Need to verify each test's specific failure mode
