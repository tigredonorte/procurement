# Modal Component - Track.md

## Component Overview

Modal is a flexible dialog component that creates an overlay window above the main content. It supports multiple positioning variants (center, top, bottom, glass), various visual effects including glass morphism and gradients, and comprehensive accessibility features. The component provides backdrop control, escape handling, and smooth transitions.

## Component Parameters

- `open` - Controls modal visibility
- `onClose` - Callback when modal closes
- `variant` - Position variant ('center' | 'top' | 'bottom' | 'glass')
- `size` - Modal width ('xs' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl')
- `backdrop` - Shows backdrop overlay
- `persistent` - Prevents closing on backdrop/escape
- `glass` - Enables glass morphism effect
- `gradient` - Enables gradient background
- `glow` - Enables glow effect
- `pulse` - Enables pulse animation
- `borderRadius` - Border radius size ('none' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl')
- `children` - Modal content
