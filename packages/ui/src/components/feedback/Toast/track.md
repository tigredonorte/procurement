# Toast Component - Track.md

## Component Overview

Toast is a lightweight notification component that displays temporary messages to users. It supports multiple severity types, glass morphism effects, action buttons, and positioning options. The component includes a provider-consumer pattern for global toast management and promise-based notifications for async operations.

## Component Parameters

- `message` - Toast message content
- `variant` - Toast type ('default' | 'success' | 'error' | 'warning' | 'info' | 'promise')
- `duration` - Auto-dismiss duration in milliseconds
- `persistent` - Prevents auto-dismissal
- `closable` - Shows close button
- `action` - Action button configuration {label, onClick}
- `promise` - Promise-based notification config {loading, success, error}
- `glass` - Enables glass morphism effect
- `onClose` - Close callback function

### Task Completed - omega-3

- Fixed ESLint errors in Toast.test.stories.tsx (removed redundant story name properties)
- Updated track.md format to pass validation (added colon to **Stories**: and proper spacing)
- All 16 validation checks now pass successfully
- Component is ready for production use

## Missing things

### Context Sync Issue
- **Status**: OK - ToastContainer properly syncs with context
- ToastContainer correctly uses `useContext(ToastContext)` at line 203
- Properly retrieves `toasts` and `removeToast` from context at line 209
- Renders toasts from context state using `toasts.slice(0, maxToasts).map()` at line 249
- Each toast receives the `removeToast` callback from context at line 258

### Test Coverage
- **Status**: Comprehensive
- Tests cover all major functionality including:
  - Basic interaction (add/remove/clear)
  - Form integration with custom messages
  - Keyboard navigation and accessibility
  - Screen reader support with ARIA attributes
  - Focus management for actions and close buttons
  - Responsive design across viewports
  - Theme variations and glass morphism
  - Visual states for all variants
  - Performance with stress testing (50 toasts)
  - Edge cases (long messages, special chars, promise race conditions)
  - Integration with ToastContainer component

### Implementation Quality
- **Status**: OK
- Provider-consumer pattern properly implemented
- Context provides all necessary methods (addToast, removeToast, clearAllToasts, promise)
- ToastContainer subscribes to context changes and re-renders automatically
- No issues with state synchronization between context and container
