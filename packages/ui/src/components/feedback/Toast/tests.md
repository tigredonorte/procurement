## Component Summary

The Toast component is fully implemented with comprehensive testing and fixed state synchronization:

- **State Sync Fixed**: ToastContainer now properly syncs with ToastProvider context state
- 11 comprehensive test stories covering all interaction patterns
- All required story exports (Default, AllVariants, AllSizes, AllStates, InteractiveStates, Responsive)
- Full TypeScript typing and ESLint compliance
- Complete accessibility support with ARIA attributes
- Glass morphism effects and theme variations
- Promise-based notification handling
- Performance tested with stress testing
- Edge case handling for special characters and boundary conditions
- Integration test verifies ToastContainer renders toasts from context state

## State Synchronization Fix Details

**Fixed Issues:**
- ToastProvider now exposes `toasts` array in context (line 99 in Toast.tsx)
- ToastContainer removes redundant local state and uses context state directly
- Proper error handling when ToastContainer used outside ToastProvider
- Toast lifecycle management now works correctly between context and container

**Verification:**
- Integration test story specifically tests ToastContainer rendering
- All validation checks pass (16/16)
- Tests confirm toasts appear and dismiss correctly
- State management issues resolved
