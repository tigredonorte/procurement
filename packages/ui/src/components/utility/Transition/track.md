# Transition Component - Track.md

## Component Overview

A comprehensive transition wrapper component built on Material-UI transitions. Supports multiple animation variants (fade, slide, scale, collapse, grow, zoom) with configurable timing, easing, and directional options. Provides intelligent defaults based on variant type and integrates seamlessly with Material-UI's theme system.

## Component Parameters

- `children` - Content to animate (React node)
- `variant` - Transition type: 'fade', 'slide', 'scale', 'collapse', 'grow', 'zoom'
- `direction` - Slide direction: 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right' (used with slide variant)
- `duration` - Animation duration in ms or object with enter/exit values
- `delay` - Animation delay in ms (default: 0)
- `easing` - Animation easing function or object with enter/exit values
- `in` - Whether transition should be active (boolean)
