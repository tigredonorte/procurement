# VirtualList Component - Track.md

## Component Overview

A high-performance virtualization component that efficiently renders large datasets by only displaying visible items. Supports both fixed and variable height items, includes a separate VirtualGrid component for grid layouts, and features configurable overscan for smooth scrolling. Optimized for memory usage and rendering performance.

## Component Parameters

### VirtualList Component:

- `items` - Array of items to render with id, optional height, and data properties
- `variant` - List type: 'fixed' (uniform height), 'variable' (dynamic height)
- `height` - Container height in pixels (number)
- `width` - Container width (number | string, default: '100%')
- `itemHeight` - Height for fixed items (number, default: 40)
- `estimatedItemHeight` - Estimated height for variable items (number, default: 40)
- `overscan` - Items to render outside visible area (number, default: 5)
- `renderItem` - Function to render each item with item, index, and style params
- `onScroll` - Scroll event handler receiving scrollTop
- `className` - CSS class name
- `style` - Inline styles object

### VirtualGrid Component:

- `items` - Array of items to render
- `height` - Container height in pixels (number)
- `width` - Container width (number | string, default: '100%')
- `columnCount` - Number of columns (number)
- `rowHeight` - Height of each row (number)
- `columnWidth` - Width of each column (optional, auto-calculated)
- `gap` - Gap between items (number, default: 0)
- `overscan` - Items to render outside visible area (number, default: 5)
- `renderItem` - Function to render each item with item, index, columnIndex, rowIndex, and style params
- `onScroll` - Scroll event handler receiving scrollTop

## Missing things

### Quality Assessment Summary:

- **Tests**: OK - 11 comprehensive test stories with real behavioral assertions
- **Implementation**: OK - Proper virtualization with fixed/variable heights and grid support

### Issues Found:

None found. The component is excellent with:

- Comprehensive test coverage verifying actual virtual list behavior
- Proper virtualization algorithms with visible range calculation
- Support for both fixed and variable height items
- Separate VirtualGrid component for grid layouts
- Performance optimizations with memoization and efficient calculations
- Memory management with item height caching
- All tests use real behavioral assertions, not placeholders

## Lint Status

- [x] No lint errors
- [x] No warnings

## Type Check Status
