# Stepper Component Development Tracking

Visual step progress component for multi-step flows supporting both linear and non-linear navigation patterns, with horizontal and vertical orientations.

## Props

- `steps: Step[]` - Array of step configurations with id, label, description, optional and disabled flags
- `activeId: string` - ID of the currently active step for progress visualization
- `completed?: Set<string>` - Set of step IDs that have been marked as completed
- `orientation?: 'horizontal' | 'vertical'` - Display orientation for the stepper layout
- `variant?: 'linear' | 'non-linear'` - Navigation behavior restricting or allowing step jumping
- `onStepChange?: (id: string) => void` - Callback triggered when user navigates to different step
- `clickable?: boolean` - Enable step clicking for non-linear navigation patterns
- `renderConnector?: Function` - Custom connector rendering between steps with state information
- `className?: string` - Additional CSS classes for custom styling

## Lint

- [x] No lint errors
- [x] No warnings

## Type Errors
