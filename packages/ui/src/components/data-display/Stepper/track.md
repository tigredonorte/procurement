# Stepper Component Development Tracking

Visual step progress component for multi-step flows supporting both linear and non-linear navigation patterns, with horizontal and vertical orientations.

## Props

- `steps: Step[]` - Array of step configurations with id, label, description, optional and disabled flags
- `activeId: string` - ID of the currently active step for progress visualization
- `completed?: Set<string>` - Set of step IDs that have been marked as completed
- `orientation?: 'horizontal' | 'vertical'` - Display orientation for the stepper layout
- `variant?: 'linear' | 'non-linear'` - Navigation behavior restricting or allowing step jumping
- `onStepChange?: (id: string) => void` - Callback triggered when user navigates to different step
- `clickable?: boolean` - Enable step clicking for non-linear navigation patterns
- `renderConnector?: Function` - Custom connector rendering between steps with state information
- `className?: string` - Additional CSS classes for custom styling

## Lint

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Stories (planned)

- [ ] BasicInteraction - User step navigation and state management
- [ ] StateChangeTest - Active/completed state transitions and callbacks
- [ ] KeyboardNavigation - Arrow keys, Enter/Space navigation patterns
- [ ] ScreenReaderTest - Accessible step announcements and navigation
- [ ] FocusManagement - Focus handling across step transitions
- [ ] ResponsiveDesign - Responsive behavior across device viewports
- [ ] ThemeVariations - Light/dark theme support and styling
- [ ] VisualStates - All step states (active, completed, disabled, optional)
- [ ] PerformanceTest - Rendering performance with large step counts
- [ ] EdgeCases - Error handling, empty states, invalid configurations
- [ ] IntegrationTest - Integration with forms and multi-step workflows

### Static Stories (planned)

- [ ] Default - Basic horizontal stepper with minimal configuration
- [ ] Horizontal - Standard horizontal layout with step descriptions
- [ ] Vertical - Vertical orientation layout for sidebar navigation
- [ ] Linear - Linear progression restricting forward navigation
- [ ] NonLinear - Non-linear with clickable step navigation
- [ ] WithOptional - Steps marked as optional with visual indicators
- [ ] WithDisabled - Disabled steps that cannot be activated
- [ ] Completed - Steps marked as completed with checkmark indicators
- [ ] CustomConnectors - Custom connector rendering between steps
- [ ] LongLabels - Handling of long step labels and descriptions
- [ ] MobileResponsive - Mobile-optimized layouts and interactions
- [ ] Loading - Loading states during step transitions
- [ ] Error - Error states for failed step validation
- [ ] Interactive - Click handlers and navigation callbacks
- [ ] AllVariants - All orientation and variant combinations
- [ ] AllSizes - Different step indicator sizes and spacing
- [ ] AllStates - All possible step states in single view
- [ ] InteractiveStates - Interactive state demonstrations
- [ ] Responsive - Responsive behavior examples
