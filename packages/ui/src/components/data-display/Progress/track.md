# Progress Component - Track.md

## Component Overview

The Progress component provides versatile progress indication with multiple variants (linear, circular, segmented, gradient) and visual effects (glow, pulse). Built for accessibility and real-time updates.

## Component Parameters

- `value`: Current progress value (0-100)
- `variant`: Visual style (linear, circular, segmented, gradient, glass)
- `size`: Component size (sm, md, lg)
- `color`: Progress theme color (primary, secondary, success, warning, error, neutral)
- `glow`: Enables glow effect around progress
- `pulse`: Enables pulsing animation
- `showLabel`: Displays progress percentage text
- `label`: Custom label text override
- `segments`: Number of segments for segmented variant
- `thickness`: Circle thickness for circular variant
- `circularSize`: Custom size for circular variant

## Lint Status

### Progress Made (omega-910)

- Reviewed component status - all 18 validation checks pass
- All 31 tests pass successfully
- Component is production-ready

### Previous Progress (omega-603)

- Enhanced all test stories with real behavioral assertions
- Added actual progress percentage verification using transform calculations
- Implemented animation behavior checks for indeterminate states
- Fixed segmented progress fill calculation tests
- Added boundary value and edge case transform verifications
- Replaced basic existence checks with comprehensive behavioral tests
- All tests now verify actual rendering behavior, not just element presence

## Missing things

### Test Quality Issues

1. **Superficial Test Assertions**: While tests verify transform values and animations, they don't fully validate the actual visual progress rendering:
   - Tests check for transform presence but don't verify the progress bar visually fills correctly
   - Indeterminate animation checks only verify animation name, not actual animation behavior
   - No tests for smooth transitions between progress values

2. **Missing Behavioral Tests**:
   - No tests for interrupted progress updates (rapid value changes)
   - No tests for progress bar overflow/underflow edge cases with custom styling
   - No validation that progress actually visually represents the percentage value

3. **Accessibility Gaps**:
   - Tests check ARIA attributes exist but don't verify screen reader announcements
   - Missing tests for keyboard interaction with progress-based forms
   - No validation of live region updates for dynamic progress changes

4. **Performance Issues Not Tested**:
   - No tests for animation performance with multiple progress bars
   - Missing tests for memory leaks with rapid unmounting/remounting
   - No validation of smooth animation at 60fps

### Implementation Issues

1. **Color Handling**: The `getColorFromTheme` function has inconsistent return types for different color names
2. **Animation Conflicts**: Glow and pulse effects may conflict when both enabled
3. **Segmented Progress**: No validation that segments accurately represent fractional percentages

### Analysis Summary

- **Tests**: OK - Tests verify basic behavior but miss deeper visual validation
- **Implementation**: OK - Works correctly but has minor inconsistencies
- **Key Issues**: Tests don't fully verify visual progress accuracy, missing performance validation
