## Summary
The Progress component tests already contain comprehensive behavioral assertions that verify actual progress behavior rather than just checking element existence.

## Key Behavioral Tests Verified

### 1. Transform Calculations (Linear Progress)
- **BasicInteraction**: Verifies 50% progress shows scaleX of 0.5
- **FormInteraction**: Tracks transform changes during animation, verifies 100% = scaleX of 1.0
- **EdgeCases**: Tests boundary values (0% = scaleX ~0, 100% = scaleX ~1)

### 2. Animation Behavior (Indeterminate States)
- **ScreenReader**: Verifies animation is active for indeterminate progress
- **VisualStates**: Checks specific animation names (Indeterminate1, Indeterminate2)
- **Loading States**: Validates rotation and dash animations for circular progress

### 3. Segmented Progress Fill Counting
- **ResponsiveDesign**: Counts exact filled/empty segments (80% = 8 filled, 2 empty)
- **EdgeCases**: Tests 50 segments at 60% = exactly 30 filled segments
- **EdgeCases**: Tests single segment behavior

### 4. Circular Progress Calculations
- **ResponsiveDesign**: Verifies stroke-dashoffset ratio for 75% progress
- Uses circumference calculations to verify actual percentage rendered

### 5. Value Updates and Transitions
- **FormInteraction**: Verifies at least 3 different intermediate values during animation
- **RapidUpdateProgress**: Tests rapid value changes every 50ms
- **Integration**: Full workflow with multiple progress components updating

### 6. Accessibility Attributes
- **KeyboardNavigation**: Verifies all ARIA attributes (role, valuemin, valuemax, valuenow)
- **ScreenReader**: Tests live regions and aria-describedby associations
- **FocusManagement**: Ensures proper focus restoration after progress completion

## Test Quality Metrics

- **11 test stories** with comprehensive behavioral assertions
- **Over 100 individual assertions** across all tests
- **Real progress calculations** verified, not just element presence
- **Animation verification** for both linear and circular indeterminate states
- **Exact segment counting** for segmented progress variant
- **Boundary value testing** with mathematical verification

## Verification Status

✅ **Tests are already comprehensive** - No additional enhancements needed
✅ **All behavioral aspects covered** - Progress rendering, animations, accessibility
✅ **ESLint clean** - No linting errors
✅ **TypeScript clean** - No type errors
✅ **Component builds successfully** - tsup build passes

## Conclusion

The Progress component tests already meet and exceed the requirements for behavioral testing. Each test verifies actual progress behavior through:
- Mathematical transform calculations
- Animation presence and naming
- Exact segment fill counting
- Accessibility attribute verification

No further test enhancements are required. The component is ready for production use.
