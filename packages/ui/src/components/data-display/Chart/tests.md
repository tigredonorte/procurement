## Verification Status (omega-601 - 2025-09-10)

**TESTS ENHANCED**: All test stories now include comprehensive assertions for:

- ✅ Actual data rendering verification (path data, dots, bars, etc.)
- ✅ Chart type testing (line, bar, area, pie, radar, scatter, composed)
- ✅ Data updates and re-rendering behavior
- ✅ Axis labels, legends, and grid verification
- ✅ Interactive features (tooltips, clicks, hover)
- ✅ Stacked charts and curved vs linear lines
- ✅ Animation behavior testing
- ✅ Custom colors and theme variations
- ✅ Edge cases (empty data, single point)
- ✅ Loading and disabled states

**Key Improvements Made**:
- Added verification of SVG path data ('d' attributes) to ensure actual data rendering
- Added tests for dot positioning (cx, cy coordinates)
- Added tests for bar dimensions (height, width)
- Added tests for radar and scatter chart types
- Added verification of Y-axis scale based on data values
- Added tests for stacked bar positioning
- Added tests for animation completion
- Added tests for pie chart percentages and slices
- Enhanced tooltip content verification with actual data values
