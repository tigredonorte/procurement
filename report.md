| ---------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Button** | ✅ Complete           | All common properties implemented            |
| **Card**   | ✅ Complete           | Has variant but not size (may not be needed) |
| **Input**  | ✅ Complete           | All common properties via MUI                |
| **Spacer** | ⚠️ Missing `variant`  | Doesn't have variant options                 |
| **Portal** | ⚠️ Missing most       | Utility component, may not need these        |

## Special Features Implementation

### Table Component Features

According to specifications, Table should have:

- ✅ **Display Variants**: default, striped, glass, minimal
- ❌ **Density Options**: compact, normal, comfortable
- ❌ **Sticky Header**: Keep headers visible during scroll
- ⚠️ **Enhanced Interactions**: Partial - has hover effects but missing selection, sorting
- ❌ **Performance**: Virtual scrolling for large datasets
- ⚠️ **Responsive**: Needs automatic column prioritization

## Recommendations

### ~~Priority 1: Critical Missing Components~~ ✅ COMPLETED

~~1. **Chart** - Essential for data visualization~~
~~2. **Carousel** - Common UI pattern for image galleries~~
~~3. **Command** - Modern command palette pattern~~

All previously missing components have been implemented.

### Priority 2: Visual Enhancement Gaps

1. Add `glass` and `gradient` variants to **Button**
2. Implement all visual properties for **Input** and **Select**
3. Add `glass` variant to **Card** (already has gradient capability)

### Priority 3: Interactive Properties

1. Ensure all form components have proper `loading` states
2. Add explicit `onClick`, `onFocus`, `onBlur` handlers where applicable
3. Consider implementing `ripple` effect for Material Design consistency

### Priority 4: Table Enhancements

1. Implement density options
2. Add sticky header functionality
3. Implement virtual scrolling for performance
4. Add column prioritization for responsive design

## Conclusion

### Current Status

The component library now has **100% coverage** with all 60 required components implemented. The recent implementation added:

- 3 Form components (Command, Label, Menubar)
- 3 Data Display components (Carousel, Chart, Sheet)

### Remaining Work

While all components now exist, the following enhancements are still needed:

1. **Visual enhancements** to be consistently applied across existing components (Button, Card, Input, Select, etc.)
2. **Interactive properties** to be standardized across form components
3. **Table component** needs significant enhancements for the specified features
4. **Code quality** - The newly implemented components may need linting fixes and optimization

### Next Steps

1. Fix linting issues in the newly created components
2. Add the missing visual and interactive properties to existing components
3. Enhance the Table component with all specified features
4. Ensure consistent implementation of properties across all components

Most components now have the basic structure in place, with the new components having full visual and interactive enhancements. The focus should now shift to bringing existing components up to the same standard.
