# Epic F — UI/UX & Design System (Initial Pass)

[← Back to Tasks Overview](./Readme.md)

---

**Goal:** Ship a cohesive, accessible UI aligned with PRA DS.

## Tasks

F1. **Theme & Tokens**

* Palette (primary/secondary/semantic), typography, radius, shadows; light/dark mode; density settings.

F2. **Core Components (wrapped MUI)**

* `Button`, `Input`, `Select`, `Table`, `Card`, `Dialog/Modal`, `Alert/Toast`.
* Start **PRAStackedModal** pattern for nested flows (GTM-style).

F3. **App Shell**

* Header/nav/sidebar; breadcrumbs; responsive layout; route guards.

F4. **A11y & Motion**

* WCAG conformance; focus management; reduced motion support.

**Done when:** Screens use DS primitives; forms are accessible; stacked modal demo works; dark mode toggle persists.
