# Monitoring & Observability - Requisio.com

## Overview

This document outlines the monitoring, logging, metrics, and observability strategy for the Requisio.com platform to ensure system reliability, performance, and quick incident resolution.

## 1. Logging Strategy

### 1.1 Log Levels and Structure

#### Log Levels

| Level | Usage | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **ERROR** | System errors, exceptions, failures | Database connection lost, API call failed |
| **WARN** | Potentially harmful situations | High memory usage, slow queries |
| **INFO** | General informational messages | Request completed, job processed |
| **DEBUG** | Detailed diagnostic information | Variable values, execution flow |
| **TRACE** | Most detailed information | Full request/response bodies |

#### Structured Logging Requirements
- Use structured JSON logging format
- Include correlation IDs for request tracing
- Add metadata: service name, environment, version
- Implement proper log rotation and retention
- Use appropriate transports (console, file, centralized)

### 1.2 Logging Patterns

#### Request Logging
- Log all incoming requests with unique request ID
- Track method, path, query parameters, user context
- Measure and log response times
- Flag slow requests (>1 second) as warnings
- Include response status codes and content length

#### Business Event Logging
- Research request lifecycle (created, processing, completed, failed)
- Webhook delivery attempts and results
- User authentication events
- Permission checks and authorization failures
- External API calls and responses

#### Error Logging
- Full stack traces for exceptions
- Request context when errors occur
- User information for troubleshooting
- Environment details for reproduction
- Recovery actions taken

### 1.3 Log Aggregation and Analysis

#### Centralized Logging Architecture
- **Collection**: Log agents on each service
- **Transport**: Secure log shipping to central store
- **Storage**: Elasticsearch or similar for indexing
- **Analysis**: Kibana dashboards for visualization
- **Alerting**: Automated alerts for critical patterns

#### Log Retention Policy
- Production logs: 30 days hot storage, 90 days cold storage
- Debug logs: 7 days
- Audit logs: 1 year minimum
- Compliance logs: As per regulatory requirements

## 2. Metrics Collection

### 2.1 Application Metrics

#### Business Metrics
- Research requests per minute/hour/day
- Average processing time per request
- Success/failure rates
- API usage by endpoint
- User activity patterns
- Webhook delivery success rate

#### Performance Metrics
- Response time percentiles (P50, P95, P99)
- Throughput (requests per second)
- Error rates by endpoint
- Database query performance
- External API response times
- Queue processing rates

#### Resource Metrics
- CPU utilization by service
- Memory usage and garbage collection
- Disk I/O and storage usage
- Network bandwidth utilization
- Container resource limits

### 2.2 Infrastructure Metrics

#### System Health
- Service availability (uptime percentage)
- Health check status
- Load balancer metrics
- DNS resolution times
- SSL certificate expiration

#### Database Metrics
- Connection pool utilization
- Query execution times
- Index usage and efficiency
- Replication lag
- Storage growth rate

#### Queue Metrics
- Queue depth and processing rate
- Job success/failure rates
- Processing time distribution
- Worker utilization
- Dead letter queue size

### 2.3 Custom Metrics Implementation

#### Metric Types
- **Counters**: Incrementing values (request count)
- **Gauges**: Point-in-time values (active users)
- **Histograms**: Distribution of values (response times)
- **Summaries**: Aggregated statistics over time windows

#### Metric Naming Convention
```
service.component.action.unit
```
Examples:
- api.research.create.count
- api.research.process.duration_ms
- worker.job.complete.count
- database.query.slow.count

## 3. Distributed Tracing

### 3.1 Tracing Strategy

#### Trace Components
- **Trace ID**: Unique identifier for entire request flow
- **Span ID**: Identifier for individual operation
- **Parent Span**: Relationship between operations
- **Timestamps**: Start and end times
- **Tags**: Metadata and context

#### Instrumentation Points
- HTTP request entry/exit
- Database queries
- External API calls
- Queue operations
- Cache interactions
- Business logic checkpoints

### 3.2 Implementation Approach

#### OpenTelemetry Integration
- Automatic instrumentation for frameworks
- Manual instrumentation for business logic
- Context propagation across services
- Sampling strategies for performance
- Export to tracing backends (Jaeger, Zipkin)

## 4. Alerting Strategy

### 4.1 Alert Categories

#### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)
- Service down or unresponsive
- Database connection failures
- Authentication service unavailable
- Payment processing failures
- Data loss or corruption detected

#### Warning Alerts (Within 1 Hour)
- High error rates (>5%)
- Slow response times (P95 > 2s)
- Queue backup (>1000 pending)
- Low disk space (<20%)
- Memory usage >80%

#### Info Alerts (Daily Review)
- Unusual traffic patterns
- Deprecated API usage
- Certificate expiration (30 days)
- Scheduled job failures
- Configuration drift

### 4.2 Alert Configuration

#### Alert Rules
- Define clear thresholds
- Implement hysteresis to prevent flapping
- Use sliding windows for rate calculations
- Group related alerts
- Include runbook links

#### Alert Channels
- **PagerDuty**: Critical production issues
- **Slack**: Team notifications and warnings
- **Email**: Daily summaries and reports
- **Dashboard**: Real-time status displays

## 5. Dashboards and Visualization

### 5.1 Dashboard Types

#### Operations Dashboard
- Service health status
- Real-time metrics
- Active alerts
- Recent deployments
- Error rates and trends

#### Business Dashboard
- User activity metrics
- Research request statistics
- API usage patterns
- Revenue metrics
- Customer satisfaction scores

#### Performance Dashboard
- Response time trends
- Throughput metrics
- Resource utilization
- Database performance
- Cache hit rates

### 5.2 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

#### Technical KPIs
- Uptime: >99.9%
- P95 response time: <500ms
- Error rate: <1%
- Successful deployments: >95%

#### Business KPIs
- Daily active users
- Research completion rate
- API call volume
- Customer retention rate
