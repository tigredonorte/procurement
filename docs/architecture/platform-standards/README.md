- **Maintainability**: Clear guidelines for long-term system health
- **Scalability**: Standards that support system growth
- **Security**: Built-in security practices and guidelines

## Usage

### For All Developers
- Review [Tech Stack Versions](./01-tech-stack-versions.md) before adding dependencies
- Follow [Development Standards](./02-development-standards.md) for all code contributions
- Implement [Monitoring & Observability](./03-monitoring-observability.md) practices in all services

### For Team Leads
- Enforce standards during code reviews
- Update standards based on team feedback
- Ensure new team members review all documents

### For DevOps/SRE
- Use [Monitoring & Observability](./03-monitoring-observability.md) for operational excellence
- Maintain [Tech Stack Versions](./01-tech-stack-versions.md) for security updates
- Implement alerting based on monitoring guidelines

## Governance

### Update Process
1. Propose changes via pull request
2. Review by technical leads
3. Team discussion for major changes
4. Document decision rationale
5. Update all affected documentation

### Review Schedule
- **Tech Stack**: Quarterly security review, semi-annual major version review
- **Development Standards**: Quarterly team retrospective
- **Monitoring**: Monthly metrics review, quarterly strategy update
